To address the need for strategies that faculty at Miami Dade College can use when designing assignments and assessments for humans in the era of Generative AI (Gen AI), consider these key points:

Here are strategies that align with your preference for more traditional, AI-resistant methods of assessment:

### 1. **Handwritten Assignments**
   - **Handwritten Essays and Solutions**: Require students to submit essays, problem sets, or solutions in handwritten form. This approach ensures that students engage with the material directly and reduces the likelihood of AI-generated content being used.
   - **Handwritten Code and Algorithms**: For computer science or math-related courses, have students write out code or algorithms by hand. This practice not only makes it difficult for AI to assist but also reinforces students’ understanding of syntax and logic.

### 2. **Group Assignments with Integrity Contracts**
   - **Collaborative Projects with No-AI Contracts**: Design group assignments where students must sign a contract agreeing not to use AI tools. Each student can have a specific role, such as research, writing, or presentation, ensuring accountability and fostering collaboration.
   - **Peer Accountability Structures**: Include a peer review or evaluation component where group members assess each other’s contributions, which can be part of the grading criteria. This encourages genuine participation and discourages reliance on AI.

### 3. **Student-Led Teaching Assignments**
   - **Peer Teaching Sessions**: Assign students the task of teaching a topic or concept to the class. This can be done through mini-lectures, workshops, or tutorials. Teaching requires a deep understanding of the material, making it difficult for students to rely on AI.
   - **Group-Led Discussions**: Have groups lead class discussions on specific topics. They must prepare discussion questions, guide the conversation, and synthesize the outcomes, all of which require active engagement and understanding.

### 4. **Oral Presentations and Justifications**
   - **Project Defenses**: After completing a project or paper, require students to present their work and defend their methodology, conclusions, and the choices they made. This format makes it challenging to use AI, as students must demonstrate real-time understanding.
   - **Oral Examinations**: Conduct oral exams where students are asked to solve problems or answer questions on the spot. This method assesses not just knowledge, but also the ability to think critically and articulate ideas clearly.

### 5. **Adaptive Quizzing and In-Class Assessments**
   - **Dynamic Quizzes**: Use adaptive quizzing platforms that adjust the difficulty of questions based on student responses. This keeps students engaged at the appropriate level and makes it difficult for AI to predict or solve the problems.
   - **In-Class Problem Solving**: Incorporate timed, in-class quizzes or problem-solving sessions where students must work individually or in small groups to solve problems. This approach ensures that the work is their own.

### 6. **Handwritten Exams and In-Class Essays**
   - **In-Class Handwritten Exams**: Return to traditional handwritten exams, where students must complete essays, problem sets, or multiple-choice questions without access to digital tools. This method reduces the influence of AI and assesses students’ true understanding.
   - **Timed In-Class Essays**: Assign essay questions during class that students must complete by hand within a set time. This limits the opportunity for AI use and tests students’ ability to organize and express their thoughts quickly.

### 7. **Group Projects with Defined Roles**
   - **Role-Based Group Projects**: Structure group projects so that each member has a clearly defined role (e.g., research, data analysis, presentation). This division of labor ensures that each student is responsible for a specific aspect of the project, making it harder to outsource work to AI.
   - **Group Accountability Meetings**: Schedule regular check-ins where groups must report on their progress and each member’s contributions. These meetings can include mini-presentations or progress reports, ensuring ongoing engagement.

### 8. **Portfolio Assessments with Personal Reflection**
   - **Reflective Portfolios**: Require students to compile a portfolio of their work throughout the semester, including a reflective component where they discuss their learning process, challenges, and growth. This personal reflection is difficult for AI to generate.
   - **Iterative Feedback and Revision**: Incorporate a process where students submit drafts, receive feedback, and revise their work over time. This iterative approach emphasizes the development process and reduces the effectiveness of AI-generated content.

### 9. **Simulated Real-World Problems**
   - **Case Studies and Simulations**: Use case studies or simulations that evolve over time, requiring students to adapt their solutions as new information emerges. These dynamic assignments are harder for AI to manage because they require ongoing critical thinking and adaptation.
   - **Interactive Problem-Solving Sessions**: Engage students in live problem-solving activities that mimic real-world scenarios. These sessions can be done in class, where students must collaborate and respond in real-time.

### 10. **Peer-Review and Collaborative Assessments**
   - **Peer-Reviewed Projects**: Implement a peer review system where students must evaluate each other’s work. This process encourages critical analysis and provides a human element to the assessment, reducing the potential influence of AI.
   - **Collaborative Grading**: Involve students in the grading process by having them participate in evaluating group projects or presentations. This collaborative approach fosters accountability and deeper engagement.

These strategies focus on human interaction, real-time engagement, and personalized assessments, making it more challenging for AI to play a significant role in completing assignments or assessments.

Here are 10 more strategies that align with your preference for designing assignments and assessments that are harder for AI to influence:

### 1. **Proctored Exams and Use of Respondus**
   - **Respondus LockDown Browser**: Implement the Respondus LockDown Browser for online exams, which restricts students' ability to navigate away from the exam screen. Combine this with webcam monitoring to ensure students are not using unauthorized resources.
   - **On-Camera or In-Person Exams**: For online courses, require students to be on camera during exams, using tools like Respondus Monitor to record their environment. Alternatively, mandate that students take mid-term or final exams in a proctored setting, either on-campus or at an approved testing center, to ensure academic integrity.

### 2. **Practical Skill Demonstrations**
   - **Hands-On Demonstrations**: In subjects like science, engineering, or art, require students to perform hands-on tasks or create physical projects. For example, a chemistry student might need to conduct an experiment and document the process, or an art student might submit a physical portfolio.
   - **Live Skill Assessments**: Have students demonstrate specific skills live, either in person or via a video call. This could be anything from solving a complex problem on a whiteboard to performing a musical piece.

### 3. **Fieldwork and Applied Research**
   - **Field Studies**: Assign fieldwork that requires students to collect data, conduct observations, or engage with the community. For example, environmental science students might need to collect samples from a local ecosystem, or sociology students might conduct interviews.
   - **Applied Research Projects**: Have students design and conduct their own research projects, where they apply theoretical knowledge to real-world situations. This could include case studies, experiments, or surveys that they then analyze and report on.

### 4. **Capstone Projects**
   - **Comprehensive Capstone Projects**: For final year students, require a capstone project that synthesizes their learning across multiple courses. This project should be original, require significant research and practical application, and include a presentation or defense.
   - **Portfolio Review**: As part of the capstone, students could compile a portfolio of their work throughout their academic career, along with reflective essays on their learning journey and how their work has evolved.

### 5. **Interactive and Collaborative Digital Tools**
   - **Collaborative Wikis**: Use tools like Google Docs or course-specific wikis where students collaboratively build a resource or database related to course content. The collaborative nature makes it hard to rely solely on AI, and the process itself is graded.
   - **Interactive Simulations**: Incorporate digital simulations that require students to make decisions in real-time. For example, business students might engage in a simulation of market dynamics, making decisions that affect the outcome of the simulation.

### 6. **Ethics and Reflection Essays**
   - **Ethical Dilemmas**: Present students with ethical dilemmas related to their field of study and ask them to write essays discussing how they would handle these situations. The complexity and personal nature of these reflections make them difficult for AI to replicate.
   - **Reflective Journals**: Require students to keep a reflective journal throughout the course, where they document their learning, challenges, and insights. Periodically review these journals and discuss their entries during class or in one-on-one meetings.

### 7. **Peer and Self-Assessment**
   - **Self-Assessment Reports**: At the end of a project or assignment, ask students to assess their own performance and learning. They should justify their self-assessment with specific examples, making AI-generated content less applicable.
   - **Peer Feedback and Assessment**: Incorporate peer assessment where students evaluate each other’s work using a structured rubric. This encourages them to engage critically with the material and provides additional perspectives on their performance.

### 8. **Problem-Based Learning (PBL)**
   - **Real-World Problems**: Implement Problem-Based Learning (PBL) where students work in groups to solve complex, real-world problems over several weeks. These problems should be open-ended, with no single correct answer, requiring creativity, critical thinking, and collaboration.
   - **Iterative Problem Solving**: Design problems that evolve over time, requiring students to revisit and revise their solutions as new information becomes available. This approach simulates real-world scenarios where conditions change, making AI less effective.

### 9. **Storytelling and Narrative Assignments**
   - **Narrative Essays**: Assign narrative essays where students must tell a story that integrates course concepts. For example, history students might write a fictional diary entry from a historical figure’s perspective, or literature students might create a short story based on thematic elements from their readings.
   - **Case Study Storytelling**: Have students create case studies that include a narrative element, describing the background, challenges, and outcomes in a story format. This encourages deeper engagement and personal interpretation, making it difficult for AI to generate meaningful content.

### 10. **Use of Analog Tools and Techniques**
   - **Analog Technology Assignments**: Require students to use analog tools such as physical maps, rulers, and protractors in geography or math classes, rather than relying on digital tools. For example, students might hand-draw a scale map or manually plot data points on a graph.
   - **Manual Data Collection and Analysis**: Assign tasks where students must collect and analyze data manually. For instance, in a statistics course, students might be required to collect data through surveys or experiments and then calculate statistics by hand.

These strategies emphasize traditional, hands-on, and interactive approaches that encourage deep engagement and make it more difficult for AI to take over the learning and assessment process. By focusing on these methods, you can create a more authentic and human-centered educational experience.

### 1. **Design Assessments that Prioritize Critical Thinking**
   - **Move Beyond Content Recall**: Since Gen AI can generate content quickly and accurately, design assignments that require students to analyze, critique, or interpret information rather than merely recall or regurgitate facts.
   - **Scenario-Based Questions**: Present students with real-world scenarios that require them to apply knowledge in complex, nuanced ways. For example, instead of asking for a definition, ask how a concept applies in a specific situation, requiring them to demonstrate understanding.

### 2. **Incorporate AI-Resistant Assignments**
   - **Process-Oriented Tasks**: Create assignments that emphasize the process, not just the final product. Ask students to document their thought process, research steps, and decision-making as part of the assignment.
   - **Personalized Responses**: Design prompts that require students to draw on personal experiences, reflections, or localized issues. These types of responses are less likely to be effectively generated by AI.

### 3. **Use AI as a Tool for Learning, Not Just Assessment**
   - **AI-Assisted Research and Writing**: Encourage students to use AI tools for drafting or brainstorming, but require them to refine and critically evaluate AI-generated content. This teaches them to work with AI as a partner, not as a replacement for their own thinking.
   - **Peer Review Enhanced by AI**: Implement AI tools that can assist in peer review processes, allowing students to give and receive structured feedback before the final submission. However, emphasize the importance of human judgment in interpreting AI suggestions.

### 4. **Assess Higher-Order Skills**
   - **Interdisciplinary Projects**: Develop projects that require students to integrate knowledge from different fields, making it difficult for AI to generate a comprehensive solution without deeper human insight.
   - **Critical Evaluation of AI**: Create assignments that involve students critically evaluating AI outputs, such as identifying biases or inaccuracies in AI-generated content. This not only engages their critical thinking but also builds AI literacy.

### 5. **Encourage Creativity and Originality**
   - **Open-Ended Questions**: Design assignments with open-ended questions that encourage creative responses. AI can generate conventional answers, but pushing students to think creatively can elicit more original and human-centered work.
   - **Incorporate Multimodal Assignments**: Require students to use a combination of text, visuals, and other media in their work, making it more challenging for AI to generate the entire assignment. This also caters to diverse learning styles.

### 6. **Focus on Ethical Use of AI**
   - **Discuss AI’s Role in Academic Integrity**: Engage students in discussions about the ethical use of AI in their academic work, setting clear expectations and guidelines for when and how AI tools should be used.
   - **AI Transparency**: Require students to disclose when and how they have used AI tools in their assignments. This transparency fosters ethical behavior and helps educators assess the extent of AI’s influence on student work.

### 7. **Rethink Traditional Assessment Models**
   - **Formative Assessments Over Summative**: Shift focus towards more formative assessments that provide ongoing feedback and opportunities for improvement rather than relying solely on high-stakes exams, which AI can easily assist in circumventing.
   - **Oral Exams and Presentations**: Incorporate more oral exams or live presentations where students must demonstrate their knowledge and thinking in real-time, making it difficult for AI to be a primary tool in their preparation.

### 8. **Integrate Reflective Practices**
   - **Reflection Papers**: Assign reflection papers where students must articulate their learning journey, challenges faced, and how they overcame them. This introspective approach makes AI-generated content less useful.
   - **Metacognitive Assessments**: Ask students to reflect on their learning strategies and the role AI played in their work, helping them become more aware of their own cognitive processes and the limitations of AI.

Here are some additional strategies that build on the concepts you liked and aim to minimize the effectiveness of AI in academic work:

### 1. **Group Assignments with Integrity Contracts**
   - **No-AI Agreements**: As you suggested, have students sign a collective agreement within their groups, committing to not using AI tools like ChatGPT. This contract should be part of the grading criteria, with group members holding each other accountable. Peer pressure and group dynamics often discourage cheating, as the success of the group depends on each member’s integrity.

### 2. **Incorporate Oral Defenses for Projects**
   - **Viva Voce Examinations**: After completing a major project or paper, require students to participate in an oral defense where they must explain their work, justify their decisions, and answer questions. This method makes it difficult to rely solely on AI-generated content, as students must demonstrate a deep understanding of the material in real-time.

### 3. **Use Evolving Case Studies**
   - **Dynamic Case Assignments**: Introduce case studies that evolve over the course of the semester, with new information or twists added periodically. This forces students to continuously engage with the material and adapt their analyses or solutions, making it harder to use AI for a one-time completion.
   - **Simulated Environments**: Employ simulations or role-playing exercises where students must respond to changing scenarios in real-time. This method tests their ability to think critically and adapt, which AI cannot easily replicate.

### 4. **Peer-Led Workshops and Teaching Opportunities**
   - **Student-Led Sessions**: Assign students to lead workshops or teach a portion of the class on a specific topic. This responsibility requires them to deeply understand the material and anticipate questions from peers, making it harder to rely on AI.
   - **Peer Teaching Assignments**: Pair students and have them create teaching materials or tutorials for each other. This peer-teaching approach not only enhances learning but also reduces the likelihood of AI use, as students must explain concepts in their own words.

### 5. **Portfolio with Reflective Components**
   - **Reflective Essays**: Require students to include reflective essays in their portfolios, explaining their learning journey, challenges faced, and how they overcame them. These reflections should be specific and personal, making it difficult to generate using AI.
   - **Evidence of Iteration**: Have students document the evolution of their work over time, showing drafts, revisions, and feedback they incorporated. This process-oriented approach emphasizes learning and improvement rather than just the final product.

### 6. **Collaborative Problem-Solving Sessions**
   - **In-Class Problem Solving**: Dedicate time in class for students to work in groups on complex problems that require immediate solutions. This approach emphasizes collaboration, critical thinking, and real-time interaction, minimizing the role AI can play.
   - **Real-World Problem Challenges**: Pose ongoing real-world problems that students must solve collaboratively, with deliverables at various stages. The complexity and unpredictability of these challenges make AI less useful as a tool.

For foundational subjects like math, where the potential for AI tools to quickly solve problems is high, it's crucial to design assessments and assignments that go beyond mere computation. Here are strategies specifically tailored for math:

### 1. **Focus on Problem-Solving Process and Justification**
   - **Require Detailed Solutions**: Ask students to provide step-by-step solutions to problems, including their reasoning and the principles they applied at each step. Emphasize the importance of showing their work and explaining why they chose a particular method, which is more difficult for AI to generate convincingly.
   - **Justification of Answers**: Beyond providing the correct answer, require students to justify why their solution is correct, how they verified it, and to discuss any alternative methods they considered. This encourages deeper understanding and critical thinking.

### 2. **Application-Based Problems**
   - **Real-World Applications**: Design problems that require students to apply mathematical concepts to real-world scenarios, such as calculating interest rates, optimizing resources, or analyzing data trends. These problems should be open-ended, requiring students to make assumptions, interpret results, and discuss limitations.
   - **Project-Based Learning**: Assign math projects where students must collect data, analyze it using mathematical methods, and present their findings. For example, a project might involve statistical analysis of a survey or modeling a physical phenomenon. The open-ended nature of these projects makes them harder to automate.

### 3. **Use of Non-Traditional Assessments**
   - **Math Journals**: Have students maintain a math journal where they reflect on their learning process, discuss challenges, and explore how they solved problems. This reflective practice encourages metacognition and is not something AI can replicate easily.
   - **Oral Examinations**: Implement oral exams where students are asked to solve problems in real-time and explain their reasoning. This allows you to assess their understanding dynamically and ensures that their knowledge is not merely surface-level.

### 4. **Incorporate Conceptual Understanding**
   - **Conceptual Questions**: Include questions that test students' understanding of mathematical concepts rather than just their ability to compute. For example, ask them to explain why a certain formula works, how it can be derived, or what it represents graphically.
   - **Misconception Identification**: Present students with common mathematical misconceptions or errors and ask them to identify and correct them. This tests their deeper understanding of the material.

### 5. **Group Work with Process Accountability**
   - **Collaborative Problem Sets**: Assign complex problem sets to small groups, where students must collaborate and divide the work. Each group member should be responsible for a different aspect of the problem (e.g., calculation, conceptual explanation, checking work), and they must collectively agree on the final solution.
   - **Group Presentations**: Have groups present their solutions to the class, explaining each step and their reasoning. This encourages peer learning and makes it difficult for any one student to rely solely on AI.

### 6. **Dynamic Assessments**
   - **Adaptive Quizzing**: Use adaptive learning platforms that adjust the difficulty of questions based on student responses. This personalized approach can challenge students at the right level and prevent them from relying on AI for straightforward answers.
   - **Live Problem-Solving Sessions**: Conduct live problem-solving sessions where students are given new problems in class and must work through them on the spot, either individually or in small groups. This encourages active learning and reduces the chance of AI involvement.

### 7. **Assessment of Mathematical Communication**
   - **Mathematical Writing Assignments**: Assign tasks where students must write explanations or short essays on mathematical concepts, discussing their significance, applications, or historical development. This type of assignment emphasizes understanding and communication, which are harder for AI to fake.
   - **Peer Review of Solutions**: Implement a peer review system where students must critique and provide feedback on each other's solutions. This process encourages critical thinking and helps students see different approaches to the same problem.

These strategies aim to deepen students' understanding of mathematical concepts, emphasize the process over the final answer, and create a learning environment where AI is less effective as a shortcut. By focusing on conceptual understanding, application, and communication, you can ensure that assessments truly reflect students' mathematical abilities.

Your strategy for process-driven computer assignments is an excellent way to ensure authenticity. By requiring students to submit both the computer file and screenshots of their work, you can effectively validate that the work is genuinely their own. Here's how this approach connects to the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD):

### **Process-Driven Computer Assignments with Validation**
   - **ZPD Connection**: Requiring both the computer file and supporting screenshots ensures that students engage deeply with the process, reinforcing the skills they have developed. This method encourages students to work within their ZPD by focusing on the steps taken to reach the final product, rather than just the output. The validation of desktop details, time stamps, and logged-in user information adds a layer of accountability, ensuring that students are truly operating within their current capabilities and receiving appropriate support when needed.

This approach not only prevents academic dishonesty but also helps you assess whether students are genuinely understanding the material and applying it correctly. It aligns well with the principles of the ZPD by emphasizing the importance of the learning process and ensuring that students are being challenged and supported appropriately.

Requiring students to take their final exam or midterm in a testing center where specialists protect the integrity of assignments is another strong strategy. Here’s how this approach connects to the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD):

### **Testing Center Exams with Integrity Specialists**
   - **ZPD Connection**: By placing students in a controlled environment with integrity specialists, you ensure that they are working within their current level of development, without external aids or AI assistance. This setting allows you to accurately assess their true understanding and capabilities. The testing center acts as a form of scaffolding, providing a secure and standardized environment that supports students in demonstrating their knowledge independently, which is essential for operating effectively within their ZPD.

This approach not only safeguards the integrity of the assessment but also ensures that students are being evaluated on their actual abilities, free from external influences. It reinforces the importance of independent learning and mastery of the material, aligning well with the principles of the ZPD.
